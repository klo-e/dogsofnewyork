This project is a submission as my final project for URPL-GP-4650 Interactive Web Mapping, a 7 week class introducing the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery with Professor Chris Whong @chriswhong.

This marks my first foray into the wonderful world of web development, and i have chosen to do something with the Dogs of New York dataset from NYC Open Data.
